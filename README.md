# Extraction_of_text_using_Keras_and_Easy_OCR

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract text and data from photos using EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR) and KerasOCRÂ for deep learning model predictions. The combination of these technologies makes it possible to extract text from images efficiently.


Key Features

1. Keras Image Processing:
   -> Apply preprocessing with Keras and use a pre-trained deep learning model for tasks involving images.
   -> To identify features or objects in the image, make predictions.

2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with EasyOCR:
   -> Implement EasyOCR to conduct OCR on the processed images.
   -> Extract text data from recognized characters with high accuracy.



Technologies Used:
1. KerasOCR
2. EasyOCR
3. Python
4. OpenCV
